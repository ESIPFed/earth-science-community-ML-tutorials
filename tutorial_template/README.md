# Tutorial Template

As a project designed to enable community contribution on the same objective, this tutorial template is designed to ease 
the burden of contribution for all members of the Earth science community.

## Instruction on how to use the template

The template is writen as a Jupyter notebook which can be adapted into other notebook format (e.g., R Markdown/notebook).
We choose Jupyter notebook because of its wide applications in the open source projects and its ability to integrate 
different open source programming langurage (e.g., python, R, Julia, etc).

The notebook template is separated into different sections with a brief instructions on the purpose of the section. Some 
sections are optional depending on the purpose of the tutorial.
