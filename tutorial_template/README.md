# Tutorial Template

As a project designed to enable community contribution on the same objective, this tutorial template is designed to ease 
the burden of contribution for all members of the Earth science community.

## Instruction on how to use the template

The template is writen as a Jupyter notebook which can be adapted into other notebook format (e.g., R Markdown/notebook).
We choose Jupyter notebook because of its wide applications in the open source projects and its ability to integrate 
different open source programming langurage (e.g., python, R, Julia, etc).

The notebook template is separated into different sections with a brief instructions on the purpose of the section. Some 
sections are optional depending on the purpose of the tutorial.

## Note to template users

The purpose of the Training Notebook Template is to make sure that material has a uniform appearance and that contain 
similarly structured material across different communities of practices. The main sections are:

* __Overview__ of the broad topic covered
  * __Prerequisites__ for what background information is needed to go through the notebook
  * __Targeted level__ of this notebook
  * __Learning outcomes__ from completing the notebook
* The __Tutorial__ with a balance of explanation and activity
* __Exercises__ for students to try that do not have solutions but maybe have an answer or benchmark to facilitate understanding
* __Next steps__
  * Potential follow on material
  * Other relevant notebooks
* __Examples in the community__
* __Data statement__
* __References__
