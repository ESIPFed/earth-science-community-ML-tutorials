# Tutorial Template

As a project designed to enable community contribution on the same objective, this tutorial template is designed to ease 
the burden of contribution for all members of the Earth science community.

The notebook template is maintained by [Chris Slocum](mailto:christopher.slocum@noaa.gov) and [Douglas Rao](mailto:douglas.rao@noaa.gov).

## Instruction on how to use the template

The template is writen as a Jupyter notebook which can be adapted into other notebook format (e.g., R Markdown/notebook).
We choose Jupyter notebook because of its wide applications in the open source projects and its ability to integrate 
different open source programming langurage (e.g., python, R, Julia, etc).

The notebook template is separated into different sections with a brief instructions on the purpose of the section. Some 
sections are optional depending on the purpose of the tutorial.

## Note to template users

The purpose of the Training Notebook Template is to make sure that material has a uniform appearance and that contain 
similarly structured material across different communities of practices. The main sections are:

* __Overview__ of the broad topic covered
  * __Prerequisites__ for what background information is needed to go through the notebook
  * __Targeted level__ of this notebook
  * __Learning outcomes__ from completing the notebook
* The __Tutorial__ with a balance of explanation and activity
* __Exercises__ for students to try that do not have solutions but maybe have an answer or benchmark to facilitate understanding
* __Next steps__
  * Potential follow on material
  * Other relevant notebooks
* __Examples in the community__
* __Data statement__
* __References__

As you fill out your notebook, make sure to delete the suggestion text. 

## Readability and accessibility

To help facilitate effective learning, contributors should focus on readability through using plain language, keeping the length 
appropriate, and proceeding with caution when using artificial intelligence lexicon.

### Plain language

Plain language makes documents easier to process, interpret, and ingest. We strongly suggest that notebook creators follow suggestions
for plain language. The following list is adapted from the plainlanguage.gov readability checklists: 

* Be concise
* Present each topic or point separately
* Organize to your reader’s needs (break new topics into sections to make information easy to find)
* Have appropriate section headings (questions are often better for headings)
* Use short sections/cells
* Keep sentences short (should be shorter than you would use on paper)
* Use short lists and bullets to organize information
* Use tables to simplify complex material
* Write for the average reader (consumers of notebooks are likely college graduates)
* Use “you” to speak to the reader
* Use active voice
* Use the simplest tense possible — simple present tense is best
* Choose words that readers might use in a web search (this can help with defining words associated with the lexicon of artificial intelligence)

### Accessibility

In order to make the training materials accessible to all users, we strongly suggest the notebook creators follow the [web content
accessibility guidelines (WCAG version 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Although the guideline is developed
for general web content, the guiding principles are relevant to NCAI training materials. 

* __Perceivable__: users must be able to perceive the information being presented in the notebook (it can't be invisible to all of their senses).
  * For example, make sure there is proper alt text for images and hyperlinks in the notebook. 
* __Operable__: users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform). 
  * For example, when using interactive animations in the notebook, be sure to provide an alternative way to present the information that can be operated using keyboards.
* __Understandable__: users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding).
  * For example, avoid using color palettes that cannot be distinguished by people with color blindness (tools like [ColorBrewer2](https://colorbrewer2.org) can help creators choose colors that are friendlier to individuals with color blindness). 
* __Robust__: users must be able to access the content as assistive technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible).
